	<h2>Data Analysis based on Extent of Glycaemic Control, using the HbA1c Measured Values</h2><br>
	<p1>The data analysis was done using the Python Libraries of Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib to create Bar Graphs to visualize the data of Diabetes Mellitus with respect to the Extent of Glycaemic Control, using the HbA1c Measured Values. The data was divided on the basis of each Demographic Specification, namely Males, Females, Whites, African-Americans and Hispanics. Based on this, new data frames were located and created to plot bar graphs. The data was formed into Arrays having the Years, and the axis for the labels were set. On the other hand, for the Demographics of Federal Poverty Levels and Age, the data was first grouped based on the specified ranges using the Define: If, Else If and Else functions. After this, the data was plotted for the bar graphs.
