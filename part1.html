	<h2>Data Analysis based on Occurrences and Prevalance of Diabetes Mellitus</h2><br>
	<p1>The data analysis was done using the Python Libraries of Pandas and Matplotlib to create Pie Charts to visualize the data of Diabetes Mellitus with respect to its Occurrence and Prevalence in the United States of America.The data was divided on the basis of Years, and new data frames were located and created to achieve the same. After this, the count function was used for each demographic, and accordingly the percentages were set in the pie chart code.For the demographics of Sex and Race, no grouping of data was done; however, for the Federal Poverty Levels and Age, data grouping was done using the Define: If, Else If and Else functions. Then, the data was plotted for the pie charts.</p1><br><br>
