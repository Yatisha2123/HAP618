	<h1><u>DATA ANALYSIS REPORT</u></h1>
	<h2>Diabetes Prevalence and Glycemic Control among Adults of Age 20 Years and over, by Sex, Age, Race and Federal Poverty Level in the United States of America in the Selected Years of 2015 – 2018</h2><br><br>
	<h2><u>OVERVIEW OF DATA ANALYSIS REPORT</u></h2><br>
	<h3><u>BACKGROUND</u></h3>
	<p1>Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is an irreversible chronic metabolic disorder, involving inappropriately elevated glucose levels, due to insufficient production of insulin or inadequate receptor sensitivity to the action of insulin. It is one of the top 10 causes of death and one of the fastest growing health problems of the 21st Century, apart from being the prime comorbidity in the contemporary COVID-19 scenario.</p1><br><br>
	<p2>In the United States of America, Diabetes Mellitus is a significant public health issue, affecting millions of people and contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. In 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 9.4% of the population had the disorder, and by 2017, it was the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S.A, with over 83,000 deaths attributed to the disease.</p2><br><br>
	<p3>Diabetes Mellitus can lead to a range of complications, including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy (nerve damage), nephropathy (kidney damage), and retinopathy (vision loss). In addition to the human toll, it also has a significant economic impact in 2018, with an estimated $327 billion loss in direct medical costs.</p3><br><br>
	<p4>Overall, the high prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus in the United States highlights the ongoing need for effective prevention and management strategies to reduce the burden of this disease on individuals and society. Also, healthcare professionals can adapt certain individualized drug regimens in patients with a high potential of developing side effects or medical emergencies. For this purpose, there have been inclusions of combinational therapies and personalized medicine, using Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) to maintain homeostasis.</p4>

	<h3><u>STUDY METHODOLOGY</u></h3>
	<p5>The Python Codes were written for the Data Analysis Report, using different Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib which can analyze, compute and animate data. This data visualizations were divided into 3 parts:</p5>
	<ul>
		<a href="https://www.students.hi.gmu.edu/~yrajanal/part1.html">Part 1: Data Analysis based on Occurrences and Prevalance of Diabetes Mellitus</a><br>
		<a href="https://www.students.hi.gmu.edu/~yrajanal/part2.html">Part 2: Data Analysis based on Extent of Glycaemic Control, using the HbA1c Measured Values</a><br>
		<a href="https://www.students.hi.gmu.edu/~yrajanal/part3.html">Part 3: Data Analysis based on Correlation</a>
	</ul><br><br>
	<h3><u>FUTURE PROSPECTS</u></h3>
	<p6>As technology continues to advance, there are more opportunities to collect and analyze data which can help to improve the patients’ condition and develop better treatment plans. There are several Future Prospects for Data Analysis Reports on Diabetes Mellitus, which may include some of the following key trends:</p6>
	<ol>
	<li>Devices such as Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) and Smart Insulin Pens are becoming increasingly common, as they can provide valuable data on blood sugar levels, insulin usage, and other factors that affect Diabetes management.</li>
	<li>Personalized Medicine for each individual patient can be achieved based on inferences obtained from data analysis reports to help patients manage their medical conditions.</li>
	<li>Technologies like Predictive Analytic Models can help to identify patterns and insights in large datasets, which can be used by healthcare professionals to develop more effective treatments and interventions.</li>
	<li>Health System Improvements can be done, as there is an increased emphasis on Patient-Centered Care that considers each patients’ unique needs and circumstances.</li>
	<li>Collaborative Research can be done on extensive levels to obtain more robust and accurate insights into Diabetes Mellitus management.</li>
	<li>Amendments of Public Health Policies can be done to develop better treatment regimens and interventions.</li>
	</ol>
